🟣 Overview

Sential AI (v1.0) is an intelligent "pre-flight check" tool designed for Web3 developers. Developed by BlockVIA, this tool leverages advanced LLMs (Google Gemini 1.5 Pro) to perform instant, automated security audits on Solidity smart contracts.

This version is completely free and open source. We believe basic security tooling should be accessible to every developer building the decentralized future.

🚀 Why Sential v1.0?

Speed: Get a full audit report in under 10 seconds.

Cost: 100% Free (Powered by Gemini Free Tier).

Depth: Analyzes logic, not just syntax.

Education: Explains why a vulnerability is dangerous and how to fix it.

🔮 Future Roadmap (v2.0)

While Sential v1.0 provides essential protection for individual developers, BlockVIA is currently engineering the next evolution of blockchain security.

Sential Pro (v2.0) is currently in development. It will be a comprehensive, enterprise-grade platform designed for protocols and institutions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: Vanilla JS, HTML5, Tailwind CSS (CDN).

Backend: Node.js, Express.

AI Engine: Google Gemini 1.5 Pro & Flash.

Deployment: Render (Web Service).

Formatting: Marked.js (Markdown parsing).

⚡ Installation (Local)

Follow these steps to run Sential AI on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/grweb3/Sential-ai.git](https://github.com/grweb3/Sential-ai.git)
cd sential-ai


2. Install Dependencies

Sential runs as a monorepo structure. Install dependencies in the backend folder.

npm install


3. Configure Environment

Create a .env file in the root directory:

touch .env


Add your API keys (Get one from Google AI Studio):

PORT=5000
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_google_api_key_here


4. Run the Server

npm start


The server will start at http://localhost:5000.
Open your browser and navigate to that URL to verify.

📖 API Reference

Sential exposes a single, powerful endpoint for analysis.

POST /api/analyze

Analyzes a provided smart contract string.

Request Body:

{
  "contractCode": "pragma solidity ^0.8.0; contract Example { ... }"
}


Response:

{
  "success": true,
  "modelUsed": "gemini-1.5-pro",
  "analysis": {
    "auditReport": {
      "score": 8.5,
      "critical": [],
      "high": []
    }
  }
}


🛡️ Security Architecture

Smart Model Fallback

Sential implements a robust fallback system in backend/ai/analyze.js. If the primary model is overloaded or rate-limited, it automatically retries with the next available model in this order:

gemini-2.0-flash-exp (Experimental / High Speed)

gemini-1.5-flash (Stable)

gemini-1.5-pro (High Intelligence)

API Key Protection

API keys are stored strictly in server-side environment variables.

The frontend never sees the API key.

Rate limiting is handled via the backend.
